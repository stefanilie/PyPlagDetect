A European parliamentary watchdog has called for tougher scrutiny of EU
spending in Hungary, as concern grows among MEPs and transparency campaigners
that a class of oligarchs with ties to the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, could
use the EU “as a cash register”.

Hungary is on course to receive €25bn (£22.2bn) from the EU in the seven years
to 2021, making it one of the largest per-capita recipients of the bloc’s
economic development funds.

MEPs are increasingly worried that funds are going to Orbán’s family, friends
and supporters, who are winning EU-funded infrastructure contracts with little
competition – a red flag for anti-corruption campaigners.

The trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with Santa Fe, in which
much capital was already invested and which was becoming of daily
increasing importance, has suddenly been arrested by a decree of virtual
prohibition on the part of the Mexican Government. Whatever may be the
right of Mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizens
or subjects of foreign powers, this late procedure, to say the least of it,
wears a harsh and unfriendly aspect.
