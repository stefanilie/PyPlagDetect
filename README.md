PyPlagDetect
------------


Intrinsic plagiarism detection system built wit Python and nltk. Probably some scikit-learn and tensor-flow in the future. We'll see.

This is my Master's Degree project. It started as a course assignment, but I realized this is what I have to do.

Details about usage and results will be updated here as soon as they are reliable.
